## Description
  This app was created to practice with using a mongo database and manipulating it with mongoose. It records user input and groups them together into collections called 'Workouts'. Each workout can hold any number of exercises that are submitted from the homepage. These workouts can then be viewed on the stats page, displaying graphs of the total weight used and time they lasted.
  
## Usage
